## Pattern Recognition Experiments

Pattern Recognition is a course that belongs to the CS Master's degree. It includes 3 experiments.
You can refer to the report in each directory to take a quick look at the result. For the implementation details, refer to each .py source file.

### Experiment 1: linear classifiers
In this experiment, I generated a dataset with Gaussian distribution, implemented Bayesian classifier, Euclidean, Mahalanobis classifiers, and applied them to the dataset. Then, I compared their performance of classification.

### Experiment 2: maximum likelihood estimators
In this experiment, I generated datasets with Normal distribution and Bernoulli distribution, and implemented the maximum likelihood estimator under different distributions.

Another task of this experiment is to train the model that fit sinusoidal with different order of polynoimal, the plot of order and validation error is included in the report.

### Experiment 3: dimension reduction and clustering
In this experiment, I implement PCA reduction on MNIST dataset, showing that data with originally 784 dimensions could actually be represented by a lower dimension with the least reconstruction error.

Then, for the clustering algorithm, I generate two datasets, one separable and one overlapped. I then implement EM algorithm and K-means algorithm.
