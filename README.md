## Pattern Recognition Experiments

Pattern Recognition is a course that belongs to CS Master degree, and the course include 3 experiments to finish.

### Experiment 1: linear classifiers
In this experiment, I generated dataset with Gaussian distribution, implemented Bayesian classifier, Euclidean, Mahalanobis classifiers and applied them to the dataset. Then, I compared their performance of classification.

### Experiment 2: maximum likelihood estimators
In this experiment, I generated dataset with Normal distribution and Bernoulli distribution, implemented the maximum likelihood estimator under different distributions.

Another task of this experiment is to train the model that fit sinusoidal with different order of polynoimal, the plot of order and validation error is included in the report.

### Experiment 3: dimension reduction and clustering
In this experiment, I implement PCA reduction on MNIST dataset, showing that data with originally 784 dimensions could actually be represented by lower dimension with least reconstruction error.

Then, for the clustering algorithm, I generate two dataset, one separatable and one overlapped. I then implement EM algorithm and K-means algorithm.
