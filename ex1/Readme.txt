Pattern Recognition Experiment 1
EECS26 111060024

Inside experiment 1 from question 1 to 6, the library that has been used is numpy.
Each question will be using function from dataset.py and classification.py, and you don't have to input any number,
the parameter of the question is fixed inside the code, simply execute command

python ex1_{number}.py

to run the code. The output of the program will be the classification loss of each classifier mentioned in the problem.
Inside the output,
e stands for Euclidean, m for Mahalanobis, and b for Bayesian classifiers.
If there are two dataset, for example, X5 and X5', it will be informed using the word 'prime'.
